Auctionator for Chromiecraft

Based on Auctionator+ by BlueAo and all credit to him and the original creator of Auctionator: https://forum.warmane.com/showthread.php?t=412904&p=3030654&viewfull=1#post3030654. I only made some small adjustments for Chromiecraft. 

Changelog for Chromiecraft: 

- Slow Scan is the standard mode of scanning because Chromiecraft/Azerothcore doesnt support `getAll`  needed for a fast scan. (This might be fixed very soon though: https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/pull/20511, so i dont know how long this version will be useful)
- Includes DepositFix for changed Deposit Values on Chromiecraft
- Some minor changes

Issues: 
- Only localized for enUS Client
